# Agile Planning

## Team Context

Our team consists of working professionals. We operate async-first using Discord and GitHub Issues, with necessary meetings held on weekends.

## Tools

- **GitHub Projects** - Backlog management and sprint tracking
- **GitHub Issues** - Task breakdown and discussion
- **Discord** - Async communication and quick decisions

## Backlog

We maintain our product backlog in GitHub Projects. Items are prioritized by value and effort, with the most important work at the top. Anyone can add items; the team refines priorities async via Discord or during weekend syncs.

## User Stories

We write user stories in GitHub Issues using this format:

```
As a [type of user],
I want [goal],
so that [benefit].
```

Acceptance criteria are added as a checklist in the issue body.

## Sprint Planning

- **Sprint length:** 1-2 weeks (flexible based on team availability)
- **Planning:** Async via GitHub Projects; weekend call if needed
- **Daily standups:** Async updates in Discord
- **Review/Retro:** Weekend call at sprint end

We pull work from the backlog into the current sprint column. Each team member self-assigns issues they commit to completing.
